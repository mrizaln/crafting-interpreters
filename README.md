# crafting-interpreters

Code and notes of me trying to craft an interpreter using [this book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

This repository contains two packages that corresponds to the following in the book

- loxi &rarr; jlox
- loxii &rarr; clox

## TODO:

- Add support for C-style block comments (`/* ... */`)
- Implement bitwise, shift, modulo, and conditional operators
- Add support for comma expressions (like in C)
- Add support for C-style conditional or "ternary" operator ?:
